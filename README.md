# Winter (Antartic)

A fork of PotPvP, porting it to 1.8 and changing mSpigot's dependency to [CarbonSpigot](https://polymart.org/resource/1-8-carbonspigot.1341).

## Information
This fork has also changed all APIs utilized by the plugin like Scoreboard and NameTagAPI.
Meanwhile, I have removed TablistAPI because I don't have an API that I can give out for free.
Although in the future, I might add an open source TablistAPI in this later but right now I don't have the time to do that.

If you want access to the APIs in "refine" branch of this project to able to use it, please contact me in DMs. I'm willing to sell our private TablistAPI along with providing general setup support for the branch.


## Note
I don't claim ANY ownership on this code, I have simply ported this to 1.8 with a few additions as my code.
All ownership goes to Hylist/FrozenOrb. I made this open source because PotPvP forks are going all around the community
being sold left to right, no point in having it privately saved.

**Credit goes to FrozenOrb/HylistGames**

Using this on your servers or forking it (and selling that fork) is allowed as far as I can give authority. All I ask is you keep the original developers' credits in there along with mine in there as "DevDrizzy". Not having these credits will be considered as you skidding this.

## Dependency
As many developers know that PotPvP requires qLib and mSpigot to function. While, qLib was removed and converted to kotlin in PotPvP-SI, mSpigot was never changed and remained as is for years. I changed this by porting PotPvP to 1.8 and replacing mSpigot with my own, [CarbonSpigot](https://polymart.org/resource/1-8-carbonspigot.1341), which supports the "Chunk Snapshots" required by PotPvP to handle arenas properly.

Now, you may try to replicate it, but I highly doubt you will succeed in getting the same results as Carbon. So due to this, You are required to purchase [CarbonSpigot](https://polymart.org/resource/1-8-carbonspigot.1341) in order to use this. But, by all means, using your own fork is not forbidden in any way.
